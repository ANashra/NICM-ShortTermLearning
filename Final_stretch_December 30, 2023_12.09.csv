The experiment should take 5-10 minutes of your time. You may discontinue and quit the experiment anytime during the investigation. Please ensure you are in a comfortable environment and can listen to the sounds clearly.  You may refresh the page if you are unable to load an audio at any stage of the study.

 

What is this study about?  

This experiment is being conducted to understand how people learn and understand Indian rhythms.  

What will this study involve?  

The study will take place completely online. It will involve listening to some sound files and answering some simple questions. It will take 5-10 minutes of your time.  

The experiment is divided into three parts:  

In the first part, you will listen to one Indian rhythm and be asked to rate some other patterns according to how similar you think they are to the first one you heard.  

In the second part, you will watch a video explaining one Indian rhythm to familiarize yourself with that pattern. You can take as much time as you want and will move to the next part of the experiment after recognizing the pattern correctly a few times.    

In the last part of the experiment, which follows the same format as the first part, you will again be asked to rate the similarity of various rhythms to a reference pattern.  

How will the data be used and stored?  

The data will be used for X. The results from the data will be presented at conferences and potentially published in journals. The analysis will be completely anonymized, and your name will not be reported anywhere.  

The data will be securely stored in a password-protected online drive, shared only among the researchers.    

What if you change your mind about your participation?  

You can withdraw your participation anytime while doing the experiment. Incomplete data will be discarded and deleted. As the data is not linked to your name or identity, you will not be able to withdraw your data after participation, as the researchers can no longer identify which data set is yours.  

Who can I contact if I have questions or concerns?  

You can contact X for any further questions.
